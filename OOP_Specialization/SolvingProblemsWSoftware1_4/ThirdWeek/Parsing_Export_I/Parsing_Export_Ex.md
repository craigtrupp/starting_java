## Programming Exercise : Parsing Export Data üö¢
The CSV file `exportdata.csv` has information on the export products of countries; you can download a .zip folder with this and other export data files. In particular it has three column headers labeled `Country, Exports, and Value (dollars)`. 
* The Country column represents a country from the world, 
* the Exports column is a list of export items for a country, and 
* the Value (dollars) column is the dollar amount in millions of their exports in the format of a dollar sign, followed by an integer number with a comma separator every three digits from the right. An example of such a value might be ‚Äú$400,000,000‚Äù.

The CSV file `exports_small.csv` is a smaller version of the file above with the same columns that you may find helpful in testing your program. 

### `Task`
1. Write a method named **tester** that will create your `CSVParser` and call each of the methods below in parts 2,3,4, and 5.
    * Each time you want to use the parser with another method, you will need to reset the parser by calling fr.getCSVParser() again to get a new parser.

2. Write a method named `countryInfo` that has two parameters, `parser is a CSVParser and country is a String`. 
    * This method returns a string of information about the country or returns ‚ÄúNOT FOUND‚Äù if there is no information about the country. 
    * The format of the string returned is the country, followed by ‚Äú: ‚Äú, followed by a list of the countries‚Äô exports, followed by ‚Äú: ‚Äú, followed by the countries export value. For example, using the file exports_small.csv and the country Germany, the program returns the string:
        - Germany: motor vehicles, machinery, chemicals: $1,547,000,000,000

3. Write a void method named `listExportersTwoProducts` that has three parameters, `parser is a CSVParser, exportItem1 is a String and exportItem2 is a String`. 
    * This method prints the names of all the countries that have both `exportItem1` and `exportItem2` as export items. 
    * For example, using the file exports_small.csv, this method called with the items ‚Äúgold‚Äù and ‚Äúdiamonds‚Äù would print the countries [Namibia, South Africa]
